#Nespresso
The sublect of my project was to  create a table with entries of id,name,type,intensity,aroma and roastiness for Nespresso coffee capsules.
###Project Description:
The scope of the project was to create a SpringBoot API with Postman mocking the Front-end, the SqL Databse as my Backend and The Business part of the API consists of my controller-service-repo. I started planning my project in Jira. 
####How i expected the challenge to go?
As expected the challenge was very demanding for someone like me who hadn't got any exposure at all in the coding before. As expected the project required knowledge of all the module that we had covered during the 9 weeks bootcamp.However working on the project i feel that i have a practical understand of the code and how the API operates.Taking into consideration that i hadn't even seen a programming code before this bootcamp i managed to complete the project. 
#####Possible improvements for future revisions
The first attempt to complete the project has been very informative for me but i didn't have enough time to go in depth of each step.Therefore future revision i would like to study in depth each step od the project.
